# 🏥 Hospital Patient Waiting List Dashboard - Power BI

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze **hospital patient waiting lists** based on multiple dimensions including:

- Case Type (Inpatient / Day Case)
- Specialty and Specialty Group
- Time Bands (e.g., 0–3 Months, 12–15 Months)
- Age Profile (e.g., Adult / Child, 65+)
- Historical trends (via Archive Date)

The dashboard is built using data from multiple hospital waiting list reports and is designed to help healthcare administrators and decision-makers understand patient backlogs and improve hospital resource planning.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this dashboard are to:

- Visualize the **total number of patients on the waiting list** by specialty, case type, and age.
- Identify **trends and bottlenecks** in patient flow using historical data.
- Provide **insightful comparisons** between different specialties and their average wait times.
- Support **data-driven decisions** in hospital management, resource allocation, and patient care improvements.

---

## 🔍 What I Investigated

- **Which specialties have the highest backlog?**
- **How long do patients wait based on age groups and case types?**
- **Are certain specialties or case types experiencing increasing wait times year over year?**
- **What proportion of waiting lists belong to Day Case vs Inpatient services?**
- **Which patient segments (e.g., Children, Elderly) are most impacted by delays?**

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- 📈 **Time-series line charts** to track growth in waiting lists.
- 🧮 **Dynamic filters** for drill-down by Case Type, Specialty, and Date.
- 📊 **Bar and donut charts** for comparing wait times and patient volumes.
- 🔁 **Linked data model** across Inpatient, Outpatient, and Specialty Mapping tables.
